ðŸ§¾Description: Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patientâ€™s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system. Knowledge about chronic conditions can inform clinical decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient's survival outcomes.

Creating a deep learning model using Keras involves a series of steps that streamline the process from development to deployment, offering a powerful yet accessible approach for building and deploying machine learning applications. I started by defining the architecture of my deep learning model with Keras, a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow. The model was constructed using the Sequential class, which allowed me to stack layers in a linear fashion. I incorporated several Dense layers, which are fully connected neural network layers, essential for capturing complex patterns in the data. Each Dense layer was equipped with an activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn intricate relationships.

Optimization of the model was handled by selecting an appropriate optimizer, such as Adam, which adjusts the learning rate dynamically and improves convergence rates. I also included techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. The model was compiled using a suitable loss function and metrics to evaluate its performance during training.

For the frontend, I utilized Streamlit, an open-source app framework specifically designed for creating and sharing data applications in Python. Streamlit enabled me to build an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the model effortlessly. The integration of Keras and Streamlit was seamless, providing real-time predictions and visualizations, enhancing the overall user experience.

Finally, I deployed the application on Streamlit Cloud, which offered a straightforward and efficient way to host my model. Streamlit Cloud handles the infrastructure, allowing me to focus on the application itself. This end-to-end process, from model creation to deployment, highlights the synergy between Keras for model development and Streamlit for building and deploying interactive data applications, making it a robust solution for showcasing machine learning models in a practical, user-centric manner.
